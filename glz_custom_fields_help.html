<h1>glz_custom_fields, unlimited custom fields</h1>
<p>This plugin provides unlimited custom fields in Textpattern. You can create custom fields as selects, multi-selects, checkboxes, radio buttons and textareas - as well as the default text input fields. Predefine values can be set for custom fields and you can select a single default value (selects, multi-selects, checkboxes and radio buttons only).</p>

<h2>Time and date pickers</h2>
<p>Time and date pickers are pretty straightforward to use. To set the required JavaScript and styling properly, please refer to the <span class="information">INSTALL</span> file that came with this plugin.</p>
<h2>Custom scripts</h2>
<p>This is a rather complex and long sought-for piece of functionality, please refer to the <span class="information">my_image.php</span> file which contains inline explanations on how they should be used. The file came with the plugin, in the <span class="information">scripts/glz_custom_fields</span> folder.</p>
<h2>Default values</h2>
<p>You can now define a single default value by adding curly brackets around a value like so: <code>{default value}</code>.</p>
<h2>Ranges</h2>
<p>If you want to define ranges, create a new custom field with the following name e.g. <code>Price range &amp;pound;(after)</code>.</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>range</code> - this is really important and <strong class="warning">must</strong> be present for the range to work correctly.</li>
  <li><code>&amp;pound;</code> - don't use straight symbols (like <code>&euro;</code> or <code>&pound;</code>), instead use entity ones e.g. <code>&amp;euro;</code> and <code>&amp;pound;</code> are valid symbols.</li>
  <li><code>(after)</code> - don't leave any spaces after e.g. $ and (after). This basically says where to add the measuring unit (be it a currency or something like m<sup>3</sup> etc.) - <code>(before)</code> is default.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ranges are defined 10-20, 21-30 etc. (no measuring units - they get pulled from the custom set name).</p>
