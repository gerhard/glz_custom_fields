### Unlimited custom fields for Textpattern

This plugin sits under the **Extensions** tab in the back-end and gives
your custom fields new life. You can finally have custom fields that are
selects, multi-selects, checkboxes, radios and textareas - besides the
default input fields. You can predefine values for custom fields and you
can select a single default value (selects, multi-selects, checkboxes
and radios only). Rather then constantly typing in the same thing over
and over again, just select or check it and you're set.

The plugin doesn't require any hacking of TXP, it's a straight install
with instant gratification.
